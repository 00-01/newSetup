# This directive enables listening on IPv6 sockets. By default, listening
# on IPv6 "any" address (::) will accept connections from both IPv6
# and IPv4 clients. It is not necessary to listen on *both* IPv4 and IPv6
# sockets. If you want that (perhaps because you want to listen on specific
# addresses) then you must run two copies of vsftpd with two configuration
# files.

# has an effect if above global write enable is activated. Also, you will
# obviously need to create a directory writable by FTP user.

# request. Turn on below options to have server actually do ASCII
# mangling on files when in ASCII mode.
# Beware that on some FTP servers, ASCII support allows a denial of service
# attack (DoS) via command "SIZE /big/file" in ASCII mode. vsftpd
# predicted this attack and has always been safe, reporting size of the

# chroot_local_user=YES

# specify an explicit list of local users to chroot() to their home directory. If chroot_local_user is YES, then this list becomes a list of users to NOT chroot().

# Customization
# Some of vsftpd's settings don't fit filesystem layout by default.
